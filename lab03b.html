      Star was the MVP of Puppy Bowl 2016 as part of the winning team, Ruff. She scored the first double touchdown in Puppy Bowl history, which maybe involved scoring a touchdown on one end of the field and then running to the other end to score another touchdown.

	Star is a Chow Chow/Labrador mix, which is the result of breeding Chow Chow with Labrador Retriever. The two breeds are visually quite different from each other, which is why Star's breed isn't that popular - people wouldn't think the two breeds work together.

	<h2>Chow Chow</h2>

	<p>Chow Chows are a medium-haired, medium-sized dog breed. They are loyal, aloof and stubborn one-person companions who are loyal to their owner but are unwelcoming towards strangers — often acting somewhere between cold and aggressive towards people and animals they don't know.</p>
	
	<h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>

	<p>The Labrador Retriever is the most popular breed in the United States, as well as in Finland, India, the United Kingdom and many other countries. A vigorous playmate, the Lab loves his family wholeheartedly and rarely picks a bone with anyone. The breed’s intelligence and good nature facilitate easy training. Labrador Retrievers excel in hunting, service work, explosive detection and companionship.</p>
